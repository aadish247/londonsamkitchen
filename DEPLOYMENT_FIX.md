# Railway Deployment Fix - psycopg2-binary Missing

## Problem
Your Railway deployment is failing with this error:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
```

This happens because the `psycopg2-binary` package (required for PostgreSQL connections) is missing from your `requirements.txt` file.

## Solution

### Step 1: Add psycopg2-binary to requirements.txt
I've already added `psycopg2-binary==2.9.7` to your `requirements.txt` file.

### Step 2: Deploy the Fix

#### Option A: Using Command Prompt (Recommended)
1. Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe) - NOT PowerShell
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```
   cd "C:\Users\Aadish\py\Londons Kitchen project"
   ```
3. Run the deployment commands:
   ```
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Add psycopg2-binary for PostgreSQL support"
   git push
   ```

#### Option B: Using the provided batch file
1. Double-click `deploy_fix.bat` in your project folder
2. Wait for the commands to complete

#### Option C: Manual Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings â†’ General
3. Find the "Deploy" section
4. Click "Redeploy" to trigger a fresh build

### Step 3: Verify the Fix
1. Check your Railway dashboard deployment logs
2. The app should start successfully without the psycopg2 error
3. Your data should now be visible in the web app

## Expected Result
After deployment, your Railway app should:
- Start without errors
- Connect to the PostgreSQL database
- Display your 4 investments and 60 expenses
- Be accessible at your Railway URL

## Troubleshooting
If issues persist:
- Check Railway logs for any new errors
- Ensure DATABASE_URL is set in Railway environment variables
- Verify the database connection with `test_connection.py`
